        <h2>Modelling: A Small City Used for DND</h2>
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>
                I really enjoyed playing DND games with my friends with our own stories! 
                One of the by-products of my stories is this model of a imaginary city, created in 2021. 
                <br>As shown below, the fancy yellow building is ought to be a small museum. <br>
                I like this small design and, therefore, one of my milestones of 3D modelling is: 
                To expand this city and add MORE details to it!

        <h2>Design: A Hair Clipper</h2>
        <div class="intro-text">
            <p>
                In early 2019, I designed a simple hair clipper that looks like a nail clipper, but is used for hair bangs. 
                The goal is to allow individuals to cut their hair bangs neatly with ease and no minimal technical required.
                I tested it on a cosmetology head and actually my own hair.
                Later, I filed a patent application and got approved in early 2020
                <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CN209936979U/zh">Patent Link (in Chinese)</a>.

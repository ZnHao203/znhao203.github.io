<h2>Modelling: A Small City Used for DND</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14pt;">
    I really enjoyed playing DND games with my friends with our own stories! 
    And one of the by products my stories is this small modelling of a community. 
    The yellow building is ought to be a fancy museum. 
    I like this small design and, therefore, one of my milestones of 3D modelling is: 
    To expand this city and add MORE details to it!

<h2>Design: A Hair Clipper</h2>
<p style="font-size: 14pt;">
    In early 2019, I designed a simple hair clipper that looks like a nail clipper, but is used for hair bangs. 
    The goal is to allow individuals to cut their hair bangs neatly with ease and no minimal technical required.
    I tested it on a cosmetology head and actually my own hair.
    Later, I filed a patent application and got approved in early 2020
    <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/CN209936979U/zh">Patent Link (in Chinese)</a>.
    Here are two images of how it looks like:

                    It's been over a month since I started my internship at Onsemi.
                    During this time, I have directly contributed to the release process 
                    of an SDK package with a focus on Bluetooth applications. <br>
                    My first Jira ticket involved improving all global flags that were prone 
                    issues due to compiler optimization.
                    I then worked on a structural change to move Bluetooth disconnection and
                    pairing handling code from the abstraction layer to the application layer, 
                    as per a customer request. <br>
                    I verified these changes on boards for all existing Bluetooth sample 
                    applications in the SDK package, including FOTA (Firmware-Over-The-Air) 
                    and freeRTOS (ARM's Real Time Operating System).
                    Currently, I'm conducting verification testings for these BLE sample applications. <br>
                    The main language I used for development is C, utilizing the Eclipse IDE. 
                    Through this experience, I have learned a great deal about embedded software for 
                    wireless/DSP devices and firmware testing using lap equipment.

                    Under the supervision of Prof. Mina Arashloo, I conducted an experiment to test 
                    the robustness of network traffic performance.
                    I used network traffic simulations to test the fairness of Linux traffic control 
                    schedulers, QDiscs (Queuing Disciplines), with a focus on the HHF varient (Heavy-Hitter Filter).<br>
                    I tested different QDisc configuration's impact on traffic shaping and throughput, 
                    aiming to better understand the behaviour of such QDisc varient and potentially 
                    disrupt a scheduler's fairness scheme.
                    To achieve this, I designed the traffic flow generation algorithms, and wrote the 
                    code to setup the experiment.<br>
                    The multi-thread program created multiple continuous traffic flows, sending UDP packets 
                    under both light and heavy traffic conditions.
                    For the same QDisc configuation, I compared the throughput plots for various traffic flow combinations.
                    For different QDisc configurations, I compared the average throughput for all flows with the same traffic generator.<br>
                    By comparing these generated plots, I noticed some exception cases with unexpected
                        flow behaviour under some specific configurations.
                    Although my research has concluded, the reasons for these exception remain areas for further investigation.

                    I designed a Python test framework for Blackberry Certicom's system-level cryptography library, 
                    to support the application of a safety certification.
                    The goal of the test framework is to achieve (1) higher code coverage and (2) proof of zero false-negative test cases. <br> 
                    From the header files, I generated JSON configuration files containing information for all individual functions. 
                    I then customized the configuration files to include setup and teardown processes for each functions, 
                    as they are different steps in the entire encryption/decription process. 
                    I integrated this framework into the testware Makefile system, allowing Python to generate the test 
                    files in C during compilation process. 
                    These new test files will be executed along with the manually written testware. <br>
                    For the second goal, I designed a runtime fault injection feature using a statistical approach.
                    The user inputs a number for the fault injection percentage, and using macros and an existing random number generator, 
                    the framework decides whether to insert a fault to a test case based on that percentage.
                    With no false-negative test cases, the detected fault percentage approached the exact same 
                    percentage as the user input in a long run. <br>
                    The automated test framework supports the testing of all ECC varient algorithms and SHA256. 
                    The development is in Linux environment, using Virtual Box.

                    During my second term at Microchip, I focused on various C++ dynamic-linked libraries used for chip-flashing, 
                    specifically for the addition of a new device, the Universal Controller (UC), which serves as an intermediate 
                    device between the PC and the Evaluation Board (EVB) connection. <br>
                    For the Azurite series platforms, I developed a device driver and interface to use the UC to control multiple chip platforms.
                    This involved adding support for the UC as an intermediary device. Additionally, I addressed external stomer requests 
                    by revolving DLL bugs for the driver of a prototype chip board.<br>
                    I also enhanced chip communication speed in I2C mode by changing from single-byte transmission to multi-byte transmission.
                    Other tasks included reorganizing the code structure of the DLL library and performing regression tests and verification tests 
                    for my modifications. <br>
                    The code was written in C++, and the development environment was Windows.

                    Additionally, I reorganized the tool's code structure to be chip-platform-independent, makding future expansions easier.

                    From the term-long course project from the graduate-level Digital Forensics and Incident Response course, I used Kali 
                    Linux to perform differnet investigations including file forensics of a USB drive, file system forensics and memeory forensics
                    of two PC. I also used Wireshark to analyze a network capture file, including the inspection of contents of different packets 
                    and finding a covert channel from traffic shaping analysis.
                    This project familiarized me with concepts in digital forensics and network analysis, especially different network protocols
                    like SMTP and DNS.

                    In the Opterating Systems course, I implemented multiple kernel concepts in C, including locks, threads, and paging in a Linux kernel 
                    inside Docker container. Despite kernel knowledge, I learned a lot about system-level programming, like handling resource sharing
                    and debugging a multi-threaded program.

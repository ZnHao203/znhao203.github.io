                It's been over a month since I started my internship at Onsemi.
                During this time, I have directly contributed to the release process 
                of an SDK package focusing on Bluetooth applications. <br>
                My first Jira ticket involved improving all global flags prone 
                to issues due to compiler optimization.
                I then worked on a structural change to move Bluetooth disconnection and
                pairing handling code from the abstraction layer to the application layer, 
                as per a customer request. <br>
                I verified these changes on boards for all existing Bluetooth sample 
                applications in the SDK package, including FOTA (Firmware-Over-The-Air) 
                and freeRTOS (ARM's Real Time Operating System).
                Currently, I'm conducting verification tests for these BLE sample applications. <br>
                The main language I used for development is C, utilizing the Eclipse IDE. 
                This experience taught me much about embedded software for 
                wireless/DSP devices and firmware testing using lab equipment.

                        process for an Arm Cortex-M33 based Bluetooth Low Energy wireless MCU.
                        I made code modifications, conducted verification tests for multiple BLE
                        applications across Eclipse, IAR, and Keil IDEs, and resolved over 10
                        non-volatile global flags to prevent compiler issues.<br>
                        I also migrated handler code for 7 BLE applications, including FOTA and
                        RTOS, ensuring seamless functionality and compliance with customer 
                        requiprements. The experience enhanced my C programming skills and provided

                Under the supervision of Prof. Mina Arashloo, I experimented to test 
                the robustness of network traffic performance.
                I used network traffic simulations to test the fairness of Linux traffic control 
                schedulers, QDiscs (Queuing Disciplines), with a focus on the HHF variant (Heavy-Hitter Filter).<br>
                I tested different QDisc configurations' impact on traffic shaping and throughput, 
                aiming to understand better the behaviour of such QDisc variants and potentially 
                disrupt a scheduler's fairness scheme.
                To achieve this, I designed the traffic flow generation algorithms and wrote the 
                code to set up the experiment.<br>
                The multi-thread program created multiple continuous traffic flows, sending UDP packets 
                under both light and heavy traffic conditions.
                For the same QDisc configuration, I compared the throughput plots for various traffic flow combinations.
                For different QDisc configurations, I compared the average throughput for all flows with the same traffic generator.<br>
                By comparing these generated plots, I noticed some exception cases with unexpected
                flow behaviour under some specific configurations.
                Although my research has concluded, the reasons for these exceptions remain areas for further investigation.

                I designed a Python test framework for Blackberry Certicom's system-level cryptography library, 
                to support the application of a safety certification.
                The test framework aims to achieve (1) higher code coverage and (2) proof of zero false-negative test cases. <br> 
                I generated JSON configuration files from the header files containing information for all individual functions. 
                I then customized the configuration files to include setup and teardown processes for each function, 
                as they are different steps in the encryption/decryption process. 
                I integrated this framework into the testware Makefile system, allowing Python to generate the test 
                files in C during the compilation process. 
                The testware then executes these new test files and the manually written test cases. <br>
                I designed a runtime fault injection feature for the second goal using a statistical approach.
                The user inputs a number for the fault injection percentage, and using macros and an existing random number generator, 
                the framework decides whether to insert a fault to a test case based on that percentage.
                With no false-negative test cases, the detected fault percentage approached the same 
                percentage as the user input in the long run. <br>
                The automated test framework supports testing all ECC variant algorithms and SHA256.

                        I contributed to a Python validation tool for Azurite-series chip platforms.
                        My changes involved transitioning from an older TCL tool to Python, which 
                        enhanced code generation and test automation flexibility. I imported existing 
                        features from the TCL tool and added new ones to support a switch box for 
                        managing multiple chip platforms. As part of the development process, I 
                        reorganized the tool's code structure to be chip-platform-independent, a 
                        strategic move that makes future expansions and updates much easier.
                        I also improved the accuracy of oscilloscope measurement methods within a 
                        Python equipment library.

                    <p>
                        For my first internship, I designed a Python tool to analyze the code 
                        coverage of TCL/Tk source code and generate HTML reports for regression 
                        tests, similar to the LCOV tool in GCC. The tool uses lexers and parsers 
                        to analyze and modify source code and process output logs to calculate 
                        code coverage. I later expanded it to process Python and Basic code.<br>
                        Using the validation tool, I detected uncovered branches and syntax errors 
                        in the source code, creating four Jira tickets for source code improvement.
                        After I presented the tool, multiple QA project groups adopted it. <br>

                            After completing OpenAI's GPT prompting course, I developed a Python script to filter my school's career website - 
                            WaterlooWorks for job postings that match my interests. Given the account info and website link, the script gathers 
                            information for each job, processes it, and then uses GPT to summarize job descriptions. It generates a table of selected 
                            jobs with crucial information such as job requirements, company introductions, and other details, aiding my job application process.

                            From the term-long course project from the graduate-level Digital Forensics and Incident Response course, I used Kali Linux to perform different investigations, including file forensics of a USB drive, file system forensics and memory forensics
                            of two PCs. I also used Wireshark to analyze a network capture file, including inspecting the contents of different packets 
                            and finding a covert channel from traffic shaping analysis.
                            This project familiarized me with concepts in digital forensics and network analysis, especially for different network protocols
                            like SMTP and DNS.

                It's been over a month since I started my internship at Onsemi.
                During this time, I have directly contributed to the release process 
                of an SDK package focusing on Bluetooth applications. <br>
                My first Jira ticket involved improving all global flags prone 
                to issues due to compiler optimization.
                I then worked on a structural change to move Bluetooth disconnection and
                pairing handling code from the abstraction layer to the application layer, 
                as per a customer request. <br>
                I verified these changes on boards for all existing Bluetooth sample 
                applications in the SDK package, including FOTA (Firmware-Over-The-Air) 
                and freeRTOS (ARM's Real Time Operating System).
                Currently, I'm conducting verification tests for these BLE sample applications. <br>
                The main language I used for development is C, utilizing the Eclipse IDE. 
                This experience taught me much about embedded software for 
                wireless/DSP devices and firmware testing using lab equipment.

                Under the supervision of Prof. Mina Arashloo, I experimented to test 
                the robustness of network traffic performance.
                I used network traffic simulations to test the fairness of Linux traffic control 
                schedulers, QDiscs (Queuing Disciplines), with a focus on the HHF variant (Heavy-Hitter Filter).<br>
                I tested different QDisc configurations' impact on traffic shaping and throughput, 
                aiming to understand better the behaviour of such QDisc variants and potentially 
                disrupt a scheduler's fairness scheme.
                To achieve this, I designed the traffic flow generation algorithms and wrote the 
                code to set up the experiment.<br>
                The multi-thread program created multiple continuous traffic flows, sending UDP packets 
                under both light and heavy traffic conditions.
                For the same QDisc configuration, I compared the throughput plots for various traffic flow combinations.
                For different QDisc configurations, I compared the average throughput for all flows with the same traffic generator.<br>
                By comparing these generated plots, I noticed some exception cases with unexpected
                flow behaviour under some specific configurations.
                Although my research has concluded, the reasons for these exceptions remain areas for further investigation.

                I designed a Python test framework for Blackberry Certicom's system-level cryptography library, 
                to support the application of a safety certification.
                The test framework aims to achieve (1) higher code coverage and (2) proof of zero false-negative test cases. <br> 
                I generated JSON configuration files from the header files containing information for all individual functions. 
                I then customized the configuration files to include setup and teardown processes for each function, 
                as they are different steps in the encryption/decryption process. 
                I integrated this framework into the testware Makefile system, allowing Python to generate the test 
                files in C during the compilation process. 
                The testware then executes these new test files and the manually written test cases. <br>
                I designed a runtime fault injection feature for the second goal using a statistical approach.
                The user inputs a number for the fault injection percentage, and using macros and an existing random number generator, 
                the framework decides whether to insert a fault to a test case based on that percentage.
                With no false-negative test cases, the detected fault percentage approached the same 
                percentage as the user input in the long run. <br>
                The automated test framework supports testing all ECC variant algorithms and SHA256. 
                The development is under Linux environment, using Virtual Box.

                device between the PC and the Evaluation Board (EVB) connection. <br>
                I developed a device driver and interface for the Azurite series platforms to use the UC to control multiple chip platforms.
                That is to say, I added support for the UC as an intermediary device. Additionally, I addressed external customer requests 
                by revolving DLL bugs for the driver of a prototype chipboard.<br>
                I also enhanced chip communication speed in I2C mode by changing from single-byte transmission to multi-byte transmission.
                Other tasks included reorganizing the DLL library's code structure and performing regression and verification tests 
                for my modifications. <br>
                The code was written in C++, and the development environment was Windows.

                I imported existing features from the TCL tool and added new ones to support a switch box for managing multiple chip platforms.
                As part of the development process, I reorganized the tool's code structure to be chip-platform-independent, a strategic move that makes future expansions and updates much easier.

                After completing OpenAI's GPT prompting course, I developed a Python script to filter my school's career website - 
                WaterlooWorks for job postings that match my interests. Given the account info and website link, the script gathers 
                information for each job, processes it, and then uses GPT to summarize job descriptions. It generates a table of selected 
                jobs with crucial information such as job requirements, company introductions, and other details, aiding my job application process.

                From the term-long course project from the graduate-level Digital Forensics and Incident Response course, I used Kali Linux to perform different investigations, including file forensics of a USB drive, file system forensics and memory forensics
                of two PCs. I also used Wireshark to analyze a network capture file, including inspecting the contents of different packets 
                and finding a covert channel from traffic shaping analysis.
                This project familiarized me with concepts in digital forensics and network analysis, especially for different network protocols
                like SMTP and DNS.

                In the Operating Systems course, I implemented multiple kernel concepts in C, including locks, threads, and paging in a Linux kernel 
                inside a Docker container. Despite kernel knowledge, I learned much about system-level programming, like handling resource sharing
                and debugging a multi-threaded program.

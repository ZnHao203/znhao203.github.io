                •  Developed secure embedded software in C for wireless/DSP devices with a focus on hardware security.<br>
                •  Conducted Bluetooth stress testing for upcoming product release, ensuring robust performance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's been over a month since I started my internship at Onsemi.
                During this time, I have directly contributed to the release process 
                of an SDK package with a focus on Bluetooth applications. <br>
                My first Jira ticket involved improving all global flags that were prone 
                issues due to compiler optimization.
                I then worked on a structural change to move Bluetooth disconnection and
                 pairing handling code from the abstraction layer to the application layer, 
                 as per a customer request. <br>
                I verified these changes on boards for all existing Bluetooth sample 
                applications in the SDK package, including FOTA (Firmware-Over-The-Air) 
                and freeRTOS (ARM's Real Time Operating System).
                Currently, I'm conducting verification testings for these BLE sample applications. <br>
                The main language I used for development is C, utilizing the Eclipse IDE. 
                Through this experience, I have learned a great deal about embedded software for 
                wireless/DSP devices and firmware testing using lap equipment.

            <p>
                •  Conducted network performance analysis with simulations to test Linux traffic control scheduler fairness. <br>
                •  Explored Linux Qdisc scheduler traits and designed customized traffic flow generation algorithms using Python.<br>
                •  Tested Qdisc settings' impact on traffic shaping and throughput, aiming to disrupt a scheduler fairness scheme. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Under the supervision of Prof. Mina Arashloo, I conducted an experiment to test 
                the robustness of network traffic performance.
                I used network traffic simulations to test the fairness of Linux traffic control 
                schedulers, QDiscs (Queuing Disciplines), with a focus on the HHF varient (Heavy-Hitter Filter).<br>
                I tested different QDisc configuration's impact on traffic shaping and throughput, 
                aiming to better understand the behaviour of such QDisc varient and potentially 
                disrupt a scheduler's fairness scheme.
                To achieve this, I designed the traffic flow generation algorithms, and wrote the 
                code to setup the experiment.<br>
                The multi-thread program created multiple continuous traffic flows, sending packets 
                under both light and heavy traffic conditions.
                For the same QDisc configuation, I compared the throughput plots for various traffic flow combinations.
                For different QDisc configurations, I compared the average throughput for all flows with the same traffic generator.<br>
                By comparing these generated plots, I noticed some exception cases with unexpected
                 flow behaviour under some specific configurations.
                Although my research has concluded, the reasons for these exception remain areas for further investigation.

            <h4>Blackberry, Ltd.</h4>
            <h4>2023.9-2023.12</h4>
            <p>
                •  Developed a Python test framework for QNX's system-level cryptography library on Linux, supporting safety certification application process. Included ECC and SHA256 algorithm tests.<br>
                •  Improved test coverage with code generation. Integrated framework into test ware compilation using Makefile.<br>
                •  Implemented runtime fault injection for error detection using statistical methods, ensuing its accuracy and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I designed a Python test framework for Blackberry Certicom's system-level cryptography library, 
                to support the application of a safety certification.
                The goal of the test framework is to achieve (1) higher code coverage and (2) proof of zero false-negative test cases. <br> 
                From the header files, I generated JSON configuration files containing information for all individual functions. 
                I then customized the configuration files to include setup and teardown processes for each functions, 
                as they are different steps in the entire encryption/decription process. 
                I integrated this framework into the testware Makefile system, allowing Python to generate the test 
                files in C during compilation process. 
                These new test files will be executed along with the manually written testware. <br>
                For the second goal, I designed a runtime fault injection feature using a statistical approach.
                The user inputs a number for the fault injection percentage, and using macros and an existing random number generator, 
                the framework decides whether to insert a fault to a test case based on that percentage.
                With no false-negative test cases, the detected fault percentage approached the exact same 
                percentage as the user input in a long run. <br>
                The automated test framework supports the testing of all ECC varient algorithms and SHA256. 
                The development is in Linux environment, using Virtual Box.

            <h4>2023.1-2023.4</h4>
            <p>
                •  Performed C++ low-level programming, improved a chip flashing dynamic-linked library. <br>
                •  Integrated data transfer for multiple chip boards, added support via intermediate device, developed its device driver.<br>
                •  Addressed external customer requests to resolve DLL bugs and improve chip communication speed with I2C.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my second term at Microchip, I focused on various C++ dynamic-linked libraries used for chip-flashing, 
                specifically for the addition of a new device, the Universal Controller (UC), which serves as an intermediate 
                device between the PC and the Evaluation Board (EVB) connection. <br>
                For the Azurite series platforms, I developed a device driver and interface to use the UC to control multiple chip platforms.
                This involved adding support for the UC as an intermediary device. Additionally, I addressed external stomer requests 
                by revolving DLL bugs for the driver of a prototype chip board.<br>
                I also enhanced chip communication speed in I2C mode by changing from single-byte transmission to multi-byte transmission.
                Other tasks included reorganizing the code structure of the DLL library and performing regression tests and verification tests 
                for my modifications. <br>
                The code was written in C++, and the development environment was Windows.

                •  Worked on device-level Python and TCL validation tool for Azurite-series chip boards. <br>
                •  Collaborated with firmware and validation teams to customize features for streamlined testing process. <br>
                •  Integrated Python equipment library and designed new data processing methods to enhance measurement accuracy for devices like oscilloscopes and function generators. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed a Python validation tool for Azurite-series chip platforms.
                This involved transitioning from an older TCL tool to Python, which enhanved flexibility in code generation and test automation.
                I imported existing features from the TCL tool and added new ones to support a switch box for managing multiple chip platforms.
                Additionally, I reorganized the tool's code structure to be chip-platform-independent, makding future expansions easier.
                I also improved the accuracy of measurement methods in oscilloscopes within a Python equipment library.

            <p>
                •  Developed Python validation tool for regression tests of Proteus solutions, adopted by multiple QA project groups. <br>
                •  Created code coverage analysis method and designed lexers & parsers for code analysis in Python and TCL under Linux environment. Detected uncovered branches and syntax errors. Opened 4 Jira tickets to address issues.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my first internship, I designed a Python tool to analyze the code coverage of TCL/Tk source code and generate HTML reports 
                for regression tests, similar to the LCOV tool in GCC.
                The tool uses lexer and parsers to analyze and modify source code and process output logs to calculate code coverage. 
                I later expanded it to also process Python and Basic code.<br>
                Using the validation tool, I detected uncovered branches and syntax errors in the source code, 
                resulting in the creation of four Jira tickets for source code improvement.
                After presenting the tool, it was adopted by multiple QA project groups. <br>
